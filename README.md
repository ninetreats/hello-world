Today I depart for the mountains.  To camp at Strawberry in the snow and ice.
Strawberry was cold.  Snowy.  Icy.

The weather is warming.  I hope to ride my mountain bike more now.

Now it has turned for the worse.  There is even a chance of snow tomorrow.  Lame.

The canyons of Ding and Dang.  Side by side in south-central Utah, are great for hiking.

Weather is back to honor spring.  Near 70F today.  Why aren't hiking in the mountains?  Now am I going to add some more text and then branch the change. And one more change today before I go to celebrate some birthdays.
